polarization vs domain size
polarization vs saturation
polarization vs speed/freq
emailed pdf
440 m/s (8.9 ang)
look up domain sizes?
2826mb (low cobalt)
oscillation results + plots for presentation

why doing it*
sim based on*
geometry*
challenging questions (metglas hard)*
what trying to do, getting close*

generate seed myself
vs # domains at like 0.95 sat
try other # of samples
average angle between y dir and domain field
pdg monte carlo (accept reject, inverse transform distribution)

two wires field diagram
put between

knock thickness 25 microns, 4-6 microns
3-5 micron in paper?
sat curve for diff fields
fishy for N=1
label things better
save run data
plot vs avg # domains passed thru
weird behavior small fields (osc period)
2pi/w, w -- gyromag
