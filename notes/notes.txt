polarization vs domain size
polarization vs saturation
polarization vs speed/freq
emailed pdf
440 m/s (8.9 ang)
look up domain sizes?
2826mb (low cobalt)
oscillation results + plots for presentation

why doing it*
sim based on*
geometry*
challenging questions (metglas hard)*
what trying to do, getting close*

generate seed myself
vs # domains at like 0.95 sat
try other # of samples
average angle between y dir and domain field
pdg monte carlo (accept reject, inverse transform distribution)

two wires field diagram
put between

knock thickness 25 microns, 4-6 microns*
sat curve for diff fields*
fishy for N=1
label things better*
save run data
plot vs avg # domains passed thru
weird behavior small fields (osc period)*
2pi/w, w -- gyromag*

go down to lower sats in curve (closer to 0)
multiply velocities (weird, 100, 117, ...)
2-6 domain
go down to 0.1, 0.01 sat in x axis

400, 129 m/s
2-6 microns

true velocity = gaussian(444.5 m/s, 1% sigma)
thickness = 29.2 microns
4-6, 5-25, 5-15 microns
write up: where started, things in between
