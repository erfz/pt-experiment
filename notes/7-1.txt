implement wire diameter field
1/2 mm diameter
angled wires?
5 in hole
1.5 in between wires

B0 = 30 milligauss
curr sheet = mag field 0 inside Pb sc (1/32'')

read up ferromagnetism
saturated = basically same dir B
not likely up or down
plane perp vertical
80% saturation

I = 0.1 T
v = 500 m/s
d = 5 cm

renormalize each step?
play with tolerances

draw a diagram
